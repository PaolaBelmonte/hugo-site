In Kubernetes, there are a number of objects that are abstractions of your Kubernetes system’s desired state. These objects represent your application, its networking, and disk resources – all of which together form your application. Kubernetes objects can describe:

- Which containerized applications are running on the cluster
- Application resources
- Policies that should be applied to the application
