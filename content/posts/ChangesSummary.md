The high level change we propose is to **improve the assistance and repair process** and evaluate to hire a new employee for warehouse management.

During the interview with Rossella, head of the administrative unit at Cea Gas, we discussed the key processes and we focused mainly on processes related to heating system whose power is lower than 35 kW. Private apartment/house owners represent the **higher percentage of customers**: in fact private customers count up to 9.000 and blocks of apartments/firms up to 60.

The maintenance process (P1 in the processes table) is well organized and has few areas for improvement. On the contrary, the **assistance requests (P2) can be problematic** when spare parts are required in order to fix the issue.

The BPMN 2 in the As is report shows a critical point: there is a **considerable time lag** between the fault identification by the technician, the spare part order and the final replacement. Each technician passes by the office in the morning to deliver cash money and receipts, but also reports about spare parts. An administrative employee proceeds with the order on the vendor web portal and a new appointment is scheduled. When the part is delivered to the office or when they are notified from the vendor, the technician goes and fetches the spare part and then goes to the customer to replace it.

Few months before the interview, **an employee resigned** and quit. She used to work in the administrative office to manage customer telephone calls and spare parts orders. Instead to hire a new administrative employee, we proposed to evaluate **both a technical and administrative candidate**. The idea is having a person who can manage the warehouse, has a better knowledge abut boilers and spare parts and can also deal with picking up spare parts in the suppliers' warehouse freeing the technicians from this task.

In this report we aim to analyze how the assistance and repair process could be revised and improved according the above elements.
