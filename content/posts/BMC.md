# Kubernetes Objects

In Kubernetes, there are a number of objects that are abstractions of your Kubernetes system’s desired state. These objects represent your application,
 its networking, and disk resources – all of which together form your application. Kubernetes objects can describe:

- Which containerized applications are running on the cluster
- Application resources
- Policies that should be applied to the application

# Business model canvas

In the BMC there is a very minimal change. In the Key Activities pane a new line has to be added for the warehouse process. For the sake of simplicity, we report only the Key Activities list.

- Technical interventions on site: periodic maintenance, problem solving, fixing, repair
- **New**: Boilers and spare parts purchase and warehouse management
- Boilers and spare parts sale
- Administrative procedures and legal obligations for heating systems (e.g. efficiency, carbon monoxide emissions reports)
- Periodic training courses to maintan professional qualifications (for >232 kW heating systems)
- Periodic assessment to maintan ISO 9001/2015 certification (for >350 kW heating systems)
